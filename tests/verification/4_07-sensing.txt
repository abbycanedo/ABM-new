what model state variables are informing agents' decisions?

    An individual can perceive the other individuals and some of their properties. They choose their partners based on gender, and whether the individual is old enough, part of their immediate family, or if either individual has ever been paired.
    
    However, the persons do not consider the alleles of their possible partners, and may pair up even with those who have the recessive allele.
