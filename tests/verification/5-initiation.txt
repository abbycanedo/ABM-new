initial states? which are constant, which are varying?

	A number (init_population_count) of persons are created with the following properties:
    
        age = 0
        gender = "male" OR "female"
        mother = -1
        father = -1
        allele1 = "H" OR "h"
        allele2 = "H" OR "h"
        lifespan = 65 + random 10
        partner = -1
        child_count = 0
    
    Properties that will remain constant:
    
        gender
        mother
        father
        allele1 
        allele2

    Properties that will vary:
    
        age             // increments 1 at each tick
        lifespan        // will vary only once: if allele1 and allele2 = "h", lifespan will be halved
        partner         // gets updated with the partner's id when the person finds a partner
        child_count     // increments 1 each time the person reproduces
